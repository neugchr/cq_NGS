Patient_1:
The pathogen has neither TetA nor TetB resistance genes, as such Patient_1 should be treated with Doxycycline.

Patient_2
The pathogen possesses the tetA.v1_2317 resistance gene, ruling out Doxycycline.
It also has aph3''-Ib_146* and	aph6-Id.v1_171* resistance genes, ruling out Gentamycine.
Since no resistance against Phenicols was detected so treatment with Chloramphenicol is suggested.

Patient_3
The pathogen possesses the tetB.v2_2325*? resistance gene, since it is unclear whether this gene will mediate resistance as a precautionary meassure Doxycycline should not be given.
Since no resistance genes for Gentamycine were found treatment with Gentamycine is suggested.
